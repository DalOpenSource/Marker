Marker is an automatic marking system, designed for the Faculty of Computer Science(FCS) at Dalhousie University.

The focus of Marker is to reduce the time spent on organzing, downloading, sorting, etc. of student submissions.
Marker allows for easy marking, by running the code on the server. Thus the marker is able to easily see if the student's code compiles and runs currently. Then the marker is left only with minor suggestions of code improvement, etc.
